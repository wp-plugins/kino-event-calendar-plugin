The Kino Events Calendar is a simple yet flexible calendar plugin for WordPress enabling you to easily add event information manually.

== Description ==

Once installed the calendar will sit in the sidebar. You can also easily select an Events page which shows all current and future events in a logical order.

The admin area enables you to add, edit and remove events quickly and easily, and changing colours is a breeze. The Kino Events Calendar does not use blog posts to handle events but rather lets you add events manually. This flexibility makes integrating the calendar into client sites much more feasible, and the colour changing options allow for simple branding too.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin as you would any other Wordpress plugin by uploading the ZIP via Wordpress. Once installed you’ll see a new tab in the CMS called “Events”, underneath which are two buttons for Settings and Events.

    * Settings - change the colours of the events and select which page you’d like a list of current and future events to be displayed.
    * Events - Add the events to the calendar. It’s self explanatory, but make them active if you want them to show up on your website.

Once you have input all the event information you want then go Appearance>Widgets and move the Kino Events widget into the sidebar. Your event calendar is now live!

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
